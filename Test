<p>I am a teacher turning librarian who loves to travel and loves my family. I've been to England, France, and Spain, and hope for many more adventures abroad; I also cherish the idea of sharing travels with my students, broadening their horizons. My favorite book series for Elementary Schoolers is "Spy School" by Stuart Gibbs; my guilty pleasure is gorging on Agatha Christie until murder mysteries come out of my ears.</p> 

<p>I hope to have exposure and experience with a variety of technologies that will be useful and/or essential to my future library positions, as well as cultivate a comfort with technology and problem-solving to bring into the constantly shifting landscape of information science.</p>
